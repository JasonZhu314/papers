# MOC - Mechanistic Interpretability

## Scope

Work that tries to understand, localize, explain, or control model internals. Alignment, safety, monitoring, and robustness live here when the core motivation is applying understanding of AI systems.

## Active Papers

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID file.link AS Paper, year AS Year, depth AS Depth, status AS Status, importance AS Importance, date_added AS Added
FROM ""
WHERE note_type = "paper" AND publish != false AND !contains(file.path, "_templates/") AND contains(topics, "Mechanistic Interpretability") AND (status = "reading" OR status = "queued")
SORT choice(status = "reading", 0, 1) ASC, importance DESC, date_added DESC, file.name ASC
```

## Reading Map

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID file.link AS Paper, year AS Year, venue AS Venue, topics AS Topics, depth AS Depth, status AS Status, importance AS Importance, citation_key AS Cite

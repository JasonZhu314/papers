# MOC - Physics-Informed Learning

## Scope

Methods that use physics, PDE residuals, boundary conditions, conservation laws, or variational principles as training structure.

## Synthesis

- Use tags to separate `pinn`, `deep-ritz`, `conservation-law`, `boundary-condition`, and `variational-method`.

## Field Map

- Core problems:
- Method families:
- Evaluation standards:
- Key assumptions:

## Comparison Axes

- What each paper claims:
- Evidence used for the claim:
- Where the method fails:
- What transfers to current research:

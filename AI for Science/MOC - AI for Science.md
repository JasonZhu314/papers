# MOC - AI for Science

## Scope

Influential work that uses AI to accelerate scientific discovery, automate scientific reasoning, or build AI systems for domain science.

This is separate from `SciML`: SciML is method-first for scientific computing, PDEs, operators, inverse problems, and numerical surrogates. AI for Science is discovery-first and domain-facing.

## Active Papers

FROM ""
WHERE note_type = "paper" AND publish != false AND !contains(file.path, "_templates/") AND contains(topics, "AI for Science") AND (status = "reading" OR status = "queued")
SORT choice(status = "reading", 0, 1) ASC, importance DESC, date_added DESC, file.name ASC
```
